          Doro Wat is one of the most iconic and beloved dishes in Ethiopian cuisine. It is a spicy chicken stew traditionally made with chicken drumsticks or thighs, slow-cooked in a richly seasoned sauce of onions, berbere spice (a hot chili spice blend), and niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter). Often, hard-boiled eggs are added toward the end, soaking up the flavors of the sauce.

          This dish is deeply rooted in Ethiopian culture and is often prepared for special occasions, festivals, and holidaysâ€”especially during religious celebrations like Easter (Fasika) and Christmas (Gena). Doro Wot is not just food; it's a communal experience, commonly served with injera, a sour flatbread made from teff flour, which is used to scoop up the stew.
